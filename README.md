2. One scenario where version control would be useful, when managing a project, is when dealing with bugs or errors within code. If you encounter a bug at any point in your project, you can use version control to look at each individual change you made and pinpoint where exactly a change may have resulted in the problems you are seeing.  In order to prevent yourself from breaking what already works, when fixing errors, version control also provides the ability to save your current program and give you a chance to go back and fix the bugs one at a time. 
 
Another scenario where version control would be useful is when working on collaborative projects. With version control you are able to easily share your code and allow others to work on it with you at the same time. You are then able to see each individual team member’s contribution to the work and where they may have made any changes. This is especially important for when encountering errors because unless you were personally responsible for the changes made you won't be able to easily find where that group member may have made their mistake. 
There have been numerous times where I’ve written code and wanted to experiment with new features, however, there was always a fear of interfering with code that had already been worked on. Version control is a perfect tool for branching and merging multiple parallel lines of development. You can work on two features, at the same time, without interference and having to switch back and forth.

4.  After exchanging repository URLs with a classmate, in an attempt to experiment with making changes simultaneously, we came across a few issues. We first discovered that in order to work on a project simultaneously with someone, you need to add them as a collaborator so that they have permission to work on your repository. After we worked this out we then tried making changes to a file at the same time. An error occurred saying that “pulling” was not possible because I had unmerged files. After trying to recommit to master, a message popped up saying that I needed to resolve the conflict. Once this was resolved, I was then able to pull the file. After obtaining the most recent file, I was then able to make my changes and repush. The steps for working on a file, at the same time, with a partner is to always pull the most recent file before making changes on your end. Pushing changes will not work unless you have the most updated version of the file. Resolve conflicts by submitting to master, pulling the most current version of file, and then repush. 

5. When architecting a collaborative project, I would first want to make sure every team member was aware of how to make changes to a file. It’s important that you always pull the most recent version of a file before making changes, otherwise you won’t be able to push back to master file. Summaries and descriptions are also vital when working with others as this gives your team members an idea of what changes you made and why. If an error occurs because a team member made a mistake, it can be quite difficult to understand what exactly caused that error especially when you weren’t the one responsible for making that change to the file. I’d also recommend using branches when working with others as this will allow everyone the opportunity to experiment with new features without having to worry about interfering with the master file.
